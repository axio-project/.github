# Axio: Accelerated Network I/O Project

**Axio** aims to construct a **high-performance**, **programmable**, and **extensible** network I/O system with modern DPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA BlueField 3). 
It provides an integrated set of runtime engines, portable offloads, platform optimizations, and user-space libraries to support 100Gbps+ network I/O performance.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **High Performance** | Optimized for 100Gbps+ throughput and microsecond-scale I/O performance. |
| **Programmable** | Enables full-stack programmability across I/O interfaces, transport protocols, and offload pipelines. |
| **Extensible & Customizable** | Modular system design allows easy integration of new runtimes, offloads, and platform features. |
